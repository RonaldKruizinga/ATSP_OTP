# ATSP_OTP

For the course ATSP at the university of Groningen, two algorithms for Oblivious transfer are implemented.

The two algorithms are Pinkas and SOTP. 

Both are implemented as 1-N algorithms, Pinkas also as a 1-2 version.

These can be found in the three folders in the repo.

Finally, our testing suite can be found in the Testing folder.

An algorithm can be run by simply running the run_sotp or run_pinkas files (with the right dependencies installed)

All are made in Python3

In the constants file, one can set the number of messages used and whether debug logs are printed.
